# Backwards_words
A fun game where words are presented to the player backwards and flipped and the player has a set amount of time to figure out what the word is.

A correct word will get you 5 points
A wrong word will lose you 3 points

The words get harder as you progress through the levels from Easy to Pfft, I dare you.
